Swift Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Swift problems from Exercism.io.
Each folder or file corresponds to one exercise. All solutions are written in Swift and follow best practices for readability and clarity.

Why?

I’m solving these exercises to improve my Swift problem-solving skills and to build a consistent daily coding habit.
This is part of my journey to become a junior iOS developer by the end of 2025.

Structure
	Each .swift file is named after the exercise.
	Clean, readable code — with logic broken into small, testable functions.
